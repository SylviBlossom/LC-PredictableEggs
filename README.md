# Predictable Eggs

Makes eggs explosions predictable, with config options for each aspect.

| Config Option        | Default Value | Description |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Egg Explode Chance   | 16%           | Percentage chance for an egg to explode, determined when the egg is selected in the inventory. (Vanilla value is 16%) |
| Warning Sound        | Enabled       | Plays a unique sound (fizzling) if the egg will explode on its next throw. |
| Dont Explode On Drop | Enabled       | Prevents eggs from exploding when dropped, as opposed to being thrown. |

**Every player in the lobby must have the mod!** Otherwise, desyncs may occur.
